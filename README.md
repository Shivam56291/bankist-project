# bankist-project🚀 

Just completed the Bankist App project as part of the DOM manipulation section in Jonas Schmedtmann’s JavaScript course.

💡 This project focuses on real-world DOM manipulation, event handling, array methods, and UI logic like login, transfers, and account summaries.

🛠️ Built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks, just raw DOM power!

This was a fantastic learning experience — especially how to write clean, interactive, and modular front-end code without relying on libraries.
